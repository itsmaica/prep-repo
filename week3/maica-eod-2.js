/***********************************************************************
Write a RECURSIVE function, called `bottlesOfBeerOnTheWall` that accepts a
number (of beers on the wall) The function should count down from that number,
to 0 😞, printing the following out each time/round...

"4 bottles of beer on the wall...🍻"
"4 bottles of beer...🍻"
"Take one down and pass it around...🍺"
"3 bottles of beer on the wall...🍺"

The lines of song/text should print 1 line every 1 second to simulate the song
being sung...

When we reach 0, the following should print out:

"No more bottles of beer on the wall... 🥲"

Example:

bottlesOfBeerOnTheWall(2) // should print the following to the console:
2 bottles of beer on the wall...🍻
2 bottles of beer...🍻

Take one down and pass it around...🍺
1 bottles of beer on the wall...🍺
1 bottles of beer on the wall...🍻
1 bottles of beer...🍻

Take one down and pass it around...🍺
0 bottles of beer on the wall...🍺
No more bottles of beer on the wall... 🥲

Note the new line after each "round"...

Helper functions are a totally cool idea...
